            <p>Pappy is a 7 year old morkie. Most days he prefers to spend it laying around the house in his various favorite spots. Most of the time you can find him lying in his bed. He loves going with walks, but still hasn’t figured out how to approach other dogs without scaring them off. He loves his family and loves to keep intruders away even for his size.</p>
            <p>He also enjoys playing with his favorite basketball. He loves pushing it around, scratching it, or even talking with it. He also loves his little stuffed animal too. Pappy also loves to be scratched and will ask you to keep scratching until he is happy.</p>

            <img src="img/cheeto_cattree.jpg" width="400" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower">

            <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and
                tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven
                foot tall cat tree and sleeping. </p>
            <P>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like
                a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own
                name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.</P>

            <p>Molly is an 18 year old calico cat. She prefers spending her days lounging on the couch or curled up sleeping over a vent (or anything warm). Occasionally, she’ll go outside and attempt to hunt birds or rats (sometimes successful which is terrifying).</p>
            <p> Molly’s favorite habit is to brush against people’s legs, especially during dinner when everyone is seated around a table. She’s an attention seeker, always meowing to get as many pets and head rubs as she possibly can.</p>

            <p>Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a gas station while traveling to
                Marquette, Michigan. He was scared and malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me and
                after some healthy meals and a trip to the vet he is doing great!
            </p>
            <P>My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard time getting used to the large
                house since we were previously living in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run
                around, but when he is sleepy he is happy to be held.</P>

            " width="400" alt="Guinea pig doing his best to smile for the camera">

            <p>Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. Despite being awake
                for long periods of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be difficult to see in their
                inclosures. Guinea pigs naturally are social creatures that enjoy socializing with other guinea pigs, in
                the wild they form packs of five to ten.
            </p>
            <P>Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor, doing tiny hops,
                or likes to lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite hobby is eating, and
                he can tell whenever someone is about to give good to him by waiting at the end of the cardboard box
                patio he has attached to his cage.</P>

            <p>Bear is a lazy, food-loving dog that is sometimes playful. His favorite activity is lying in the sun on his side and lounging. He enjoys playing with his toys and loves to fetch them when you throw them, but eventually, he gets bored and just stops fetching them and lays down.</p>
            <P>Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He doesn’t like water (showers and even rain) or getting his nails clipped, and he’s sometimes even so lazy that he’ll just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go back home. </P>

            <p>Jingle loves going outside. He used to be an outdoor/indoor cat until we realized that he loved to get injured. Now, we take him on walks with a leash which he loves! Every time he sees me carrying the leash he goes crazy and meows to go out.</p>
            <P>Jingle is very mischievous, he has gotten into many different accidents. His first accident was outside; a bee stung his paw and he cried all night long. The second one was ALSO outside, he got stuck on a tree for four days. Finally, he came back home one day with his tail bleeding and ripped out.</P>
