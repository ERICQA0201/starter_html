        <p>Harbin, often referred to as the "Ice City," is the capital of Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China. It has beautiful  winter landscapes and Russian-influenced architecture, and the city serves as a major cultural and economic hub in the region. Established in the late 19th century as a fishing village near the Songhua River, Harbin quickly transformed into a vibrant cosmopolitan center, particularly due to the construction of the Eastern Chinese Railway by Russian engineers.</p>
        
        <p>Today, Harbin is most famous for its annual International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival, where colossal ice sculptures and intricate snow art transform the city into a winter wonderland. Harbin is also famous for its unique Russian foods including the Russian sausages and beer. It is a unique blend of Chinese and Russian cultures.</p>

        <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
        <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas.  In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world's active geysers.</p>
        <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.  Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.  You  can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/groups/yellowstonenationalparkinvasionoftheidiots/">Yellowstone National Park: Invasion of the Idiots</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touronsofyellowstone/?hl=en">Tourons of Yellowstone</a>, or  <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/">Cowboy State Daily</a>.</p>
